                     These are few photos that I've taken over the years on a few different cameras. I'm by no means a photographer but I do enjoy it every once in while.

               I took this on an old iPhone on a rainy day. One of my favorites for a rainbow on a gloomy day.

            <p>
            This was taken at the Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Dodgers stadium parking lot. If i recall correctly, this was the merch line.

            <p>
               This one was taken in my car down in the bottoms. I remember wanting to mesh around with the blur and getting good results. Another one of my favorites.

               This was just a simple picture of a random drawing I had done of some random lines.

               This last one was taken in our studio in the bottoms. It was right after we'd finally finished putting in the glass and lights.

               I do enjoy playing around with different cameras and lens and hopefully I'll mess around with some actual film someday.
